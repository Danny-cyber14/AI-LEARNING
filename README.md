EVOS MOOD TRACKER (PHASE 1 – PYTHON FOUNDATIONS)

EVOS Mood Tracker is a command-line Python application that interactively tracks a user’s emotional state, responds with context-aware feedback, and summarizes mood patterns over time.

This project was built as part of my PHASE 1 PYTHON LEARNING JOURNEY, focusing on mastering core programming concepts through hands-on application.

WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES

Collects user mood input interactively via the command line

Responds dynamically based on detected moods (happy, sad, angry, or others)

Uses randomized responses to simulate natural, non-repetitive interaction

Separates functionality into a PREMIUM (TRIAL-BASED) and BASIC (FREE) mode

Tracks mood history across sessions during runtime

Generates a summary report showing:

Total moods recorded

Mood frequency counts

Most common mood

Contextual feedback based on mood trends

TECH STACK USED

Language: Python

Standard Library Modules:

random (for dynamic response selection)

Core Concepts Applied:

Variables and data types

Conditionals (if / elif / else)

Loops (for, while)

Lists and dictionaries

User input handling

Basic data analysis (frequency counting)

No external libraries were used. The goal was to build everything using PURE PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS.

PROBLEM THIS PROJECT SOLVES

When learning Python, it is easy to understand syntax without knowing how to apply it in a real program.

This project solves that by:

Turning abstract concepts into a working system

Demonstrating how control flow, data structures, and randomness work together

Providing a realistic foundation for future projects involving data processing, AI logic, and user interaction

PROJECT CONTEXT AND LEARNING PHASE

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This project represents my EARLY-STAGE PYTHON DEVELOPMENT (PHASE 1) and was intentionally scoped to reinforce foundational skills.

It is NOT intended to reflect my current or future technical ceiling, but rather to document growth, learning progression, and problem-solving fundamentals.

As my journey progresses, later repositories will showcase:

Advanced Python design patterns

Machine Learning and AI systems

Scalable software architecture

Robotics and intelligent automation projects

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS (NOT IMPLEMENTED HERE)

Refactoring into functions and classes

File persistence (saving and loading mood history)

Improved input validation

Modular project structure

These enhancements are intentionally deferred to later learning phases.
